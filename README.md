# Flight Traffic/Path Simulator
## Overview
The Flight Traffic/Path Simulator is a Windows Forms application designed to simulate air traffic scenarios. It consists of two main components: a scenario generator and a simulator. The scenario generator creates airports and airplanes, generating an XML file that serves as input for the simulator. The simulator then uses this XML data to generate random passengers and cargo, and it displays the movement of airplanes on a map.

## Features
### Scenario Generator
The Scenario Generator is responsible for creating the initial scenario for the simulator. It provides the following functionalities:

* Create Airports: Allows users to create multiple airports by specifying their locations (latitude and longitude), names, and other relevant details.
* Generate Airplanes: Generates a fleet of airplanes at the selected airports. Users can specify the type of aircraft, flight numbers, and other relevant parameters.
* Export to XML: After configuring the scenario, users can export the data to an XML file, which will be used as input for the simulator.

### Simulator
The Simulator is the core component of the application responsible for simulating the air traffic scenario. It offers the following features:
* Load Scenario: Allows users to load an XML scenario generated by the Scenario Generator.
* Generate Passengers and Cargo: Simulates the arrival and departure of airplanes at the airports. It generates random passenger and cargo data, including the number of passengers, luggage, and cargo items.
* Airplane Movement: Displays the movement of airplanes on a map. Users can track the real-time positions of airplanes and view their flight paths.
* Statistics: Provides statistical information such as the number of passengers, cargo volume, and other relevant data for each airport and airplane.

## Getting Started
1. Download and Installation: To use the Flight Traffic/Path Simulator, download the Windows Forms application and follow the installation instructions.
2. Scenario Generation: Start by using the Scenario Generator to create airports and airplanes, then export the scenario to an XML file.
3. Simulation: Launch the Simulator, load the XML scenario file, and start the simulation. You can watch airplanes moving on the map and observe passenger and cargo data.

## Requirements
* Operating System: Windows 7 or later.
* .NET Framework: .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher.

Usage
1. Scenario Generator:
* Launch the Scenario Generator application.
* Create airports and airplanes as desired.
* Export the scenario as an XML file.
2. Simulator:
* Launch the Simulator application.
* Load the previously generated XML scenario.
* Start the simulation to observe air traffic and airplane movement.
